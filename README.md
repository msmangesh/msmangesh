 I'm happy to announce that my internship in Python machine learning at TCR Innovation has ended, and it's been an amazing experience. Working on an intriguing web series analytics project was one of the experiences highlights.

An expression of gratitude for your advice to my mentors, Saheel Ramji and Rutuja Doiphode, Rishav Das ↗️

You can finally stop pestering your friends for Netflix recommendations when you use Web Series Analytics. Instead, you can sit back, unwind, and enjoy the ideal binge-worthy series because our algorithms will take care of the work. We're working together to use data-driven innovation to reshape the entertainment industry, and I can't wait to share more findings with all of you. Await intriguing updates by tuning in!
